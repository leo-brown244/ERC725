## Simple Summary
A contract for key management of a blockchain identity.

## Abstract
The following describes standard functions for a key manager to be used in conjunction with [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725).
This contract can hold keys to sign actions (transactions, documents, logins, access, etc), as well as an execute function, to pass along execution instructions to an ERC725 identity.

## Motivation
This standardized identity interface will allow Dapps, smart contracts and third parties to check the validity of an ERC725 identity. Additionally, it will provide a standard interface for Dapps and wallet clients to manage various identity contracts.


## Definitions

- `keys`: Keys are public keys from either external accounts, or contracts' addresses.
- `claim issuer`: is another smart contract or external account, which issues claims about this identity. The claim issuer can be an identity contract itself.
- `claim`: For details about claims see [#ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735)



## Specification


### Key Management

Keys are cryptographic public keys, or contract addresses associated with this identity.
The structure should be as follows:

- `key`: A public key owned by this identity
    - `purpose`: `uint256[]` Array of the key types, like 1 = MANAGEMENT, 2 = EXECUTION
    - `keyType`: The type of key used, which would be a `uint256` for different key types. e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc.
    - `key`: `bytes32` The public key. // for non-hex and long keys, its the Keccak256 hash of the key


```js
struct Key {
    uint256[] purposes;
    uint256 keyType;
    bytes32 key;
}
```

#### getKey

Returns the full key data, if present in the identity.

``` js
function getKey(bytes32 _key) constant returns(uint256[] purposes, uint256 keyType, bytes32 key);
```

#### keyHasPurpose

Returns `TRUE` if a key is present and has the given purpose. If the key is not present it returns `FALSE`.

``` js
function keyHasPurpose(bytes32 _key, uint256 purpose) constant returns(bool exists);
```


#### getKeysByPurpose

Returns an array of public key bytes32 held by this identity.

``` js
function getKeysByPurpose(uint256 _purpose) constant returns(bytes32[] keys);
```


#### addKey

Adds a `_key` to the identity. The `_purpose` specifies the purpose of the key. Initially, we propose four purposes:

- `1`: MANAGEMENT keys, which can manage the identity
- `2`: EXECUTION keys, which perform executions in this identity's name (signing, logins, transactions, etc.)

MUST only be done by keys of purpose `1`, or the identity itself. If it's the identity itself, the approval process will determine its approval.

**Triggers Event:** [KeyAdded](#keyadded)

``` js
function addKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose, uint256 _keyType) returns (bool success)
```


#### removeKey

Removes `_key` from the identity.

MUST only be done by keys of purpose `1`, or the identity itself. If it's the identity itself, the approval process will determine its approval.

**Triggers Event:** [KeyRemoved](#keyremoved)

``` js
function removeKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose) returns (bool success)
```


#### changeKeysRequired

Changes the keys required to perform an action for a specific purpose. (This is the *n* in an *n of m* multisig approval process.)

MUST only be done by keys of purpose `1`, or the identity itself. If it's the identity itself, the approval process will determine its approval.

**Triggers Event:** [KeysRequiredChanged](#keysrequiredchanged)

``` js
function changeKeysRequired(uint256 purpose, uint256 number) external
```


#### getKeysRequired

Returns number of keys required for purpose.

``` js
function getKeysRequired(uint256 purpose) external view returns(uint256)
```


--------------------------------------------------------

### Identity usage


#### execute

Passes an execution instruction to an ERC725 identity.
SHOULD require `approve` to be called with one or more keys of purpose `1` or `2` to approve this execution.

Execute COULD be used as the only accessor for `addKey`, `removeKey` and `replaceKey` and `removeClaim`.

**Returns `executionId`:** SHOULD be sent to the `approve` function, to approve or reject this execution.

**Triggers Event:** [ExecutionRequested](#executionrequested)
**Triggers on direct execution Event:** [Executed](#executed)

``` js
function execute(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) returns (uint256 executionId)
```


#### approve

Approves an execution or claim addition.
This SHOULD require `n` of `m` approvals of keys purpose `1`, if the `_to` of the execution is the identity contract itself, to successfully approve an execution.
And COULD require `n` of `m` approvals of keys purpose `2`, if the `_to` of the execution is another contract, to successfully approve an execution.

**Triggers Event:** [Approved](#approved)
**Triggers on successfull execution Event:** [Executed](#executed)
**Triggers on successfull claim addition Event:** [ClaimAdded](#claimadded)

``` js
function approve(uint256 _id, bool _approve) returns (bool success)
```


--------------------------------------------------------


### Events


#### KeyAdded

MUST be triggered when `addKey` was successfully called.

``` js
event KeyAdded(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType)
```


#### KeyRemoved

MUST be triggered when `removeKey` was successfully called.

``` js
event KeyRemoved(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType)
```



#### ExecutionRequested

MUST be triggered when `execute` was successfully called.

``` js
event ExecutionRequested(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data)
```


#### Executed

MUST be triggered when `approve` was called and the execution was successfully approved.

``` js
event Executed(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data)
```


#### Approved

MUST be triggered when `approve` was successfully called.

``` js
event Approved(uint256 indexed executionId, bool approved)
```


#### KeysRequiredChanged

MUST be triggered when `changeKeysRequired` was successfully called.

``` js
event KeysRequiredChanged(uint256 purpose, uint256 number)
```


## Constraints

- A claim can only be one type per type per issuer.



## Rationale
This specification was chosen to allow most flexibility and experimentation around identity. By having each identity in a separate contract it allows for cross identity compatibility, but at the same time extra and altered functionality for new use cases.

The main critic of this standard is the verification where each identity that issues a claim, also should have a separate CLAIM signing key attached. While [#ERC780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780) uses a standardized registry to assign claims to addresses.
Both systems could work in conjunction and should be explored.
While also off-chain claims using DID verifiable claims and merkle tries can be added as claims and should be explored.

The rationale of this standard is to function as an open and very flexible container for identity.


## Implementation

- [DID resolver specification](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DID-Method-erc725.md)


### Solidity Interface
```js
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract ERC725 {

    uint256 constant MANAGEMENT_KEY = 1;
    uint256 constant EXECUTION_KEY = 2;

    event KeyAdded(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType);
    event KeyRemoved(bytes32 indexed key, uint256 indexed purpose, uint256 indexed keyType);
    event ExecutionRequested(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data);
    event Executed(uint256 indexed executionId, address indexed to, uint256 indexed value, bytes data);
    event Approved(uint256 indexed executionId, bool approved);
    event KeysRequiredChanged(uint256 purpose, uint256 number);

    struct Key {
        uint256 purpose; //e.g., MANAGEMENT_KEY = 1, EXECUTION_KEY = 2, etc.
        uint256 keyType; // e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc.
        bytes32 key;
    }

    function getKey(bytes32 _key) public constant returns(uint256[] purposes, uint256 keyType, bytes32 key);
    function keyHasPurpose(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose) public constant returns (bool exists);
    function getKeysByPurpose(uint256 _purpose) public constant returns (bytes32[] keys);
    function addKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose, uint256 _keyType) public returns (bool success);
    function removeKey(bytes32 _key, uint256 _purpose) public returns (bool success);
    function changeKeysRequired(uint256 purpose, uint256 number) external;
    function getKeysRequired(uint256 purpose) external view returns(uint256);
    function execute(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) public returns (uint256 executionId);
    function approve(uint256 _id, bool _approve) public returns (bool success);
}
```
