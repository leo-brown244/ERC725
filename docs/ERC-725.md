## Simple Summary
A standard interface for a simple identity proxy.

## Abstract

The following describes standard functions for a unique identity proxy for humans, groups, objects and machines. The proxy has 2 abilities: (1) it can execute arbitrary contract calls, and (2) it can hold arbitrary data through a generic key/value store. One of these keys should hold the owner of the contract. The owner may be a wallet or a manager contract for more complex management logic. Most importantly, this contract should be the reference point for a long-lasting identity.

## Motivation

Standardizing a minimal interface for an identity proxy allows third parties to interact with various identity proxy contracts in a consistent manner. Such third parties might include but are not limited to: wallet clients, Dapps, and identity management contracts.

## Specification


### Methods

#### getData

Returns the data at the specified key.

```js
function getData(bytes32 _key) external view returns (bytes32 _value);
```

#### setData

Sets the data at the specified key.

**Triggers Event:** [DataSet](#dataset)

```js
function setData(bytes32 _key, bytes32 _value) external;
```

#### execute

Executes an action on other contracts or a transfer of ether. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

```js
function execute(uint256 _operationType, address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) external;
```

The `operationType` should represent the assembly operation as follows:
- `0` for `call`
- `1` for `delegatecall`
- `2` for `create`

Others may be added in the future. Inspired by [ERC1077](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1077) and [Gnosis](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Enum.sol#L7)

### Events


#### DataSet

MUST be triggered when `setData` was successfully called.

```js
event DataSet(bytes32 indexed key, bytes32 indexed value);
```

### Ownership

The identity contract should have exactly one owner. This owner should be the only `msg.sender` that is allowed to call `execute` or `setData`. The owner should be the data value at key `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (you just have to pad the address to convert it to a bytes32). Transferring the ownership can be done by having the current owner call `setData`.


### Data keys

Data keys, by convention, should be the sha-3 hash of a memorable name. (The only exception is `0x00...`, which should be the owner.) If there is a need for numbering multiple versions of a key, bytes can be removed from the hash of the name, in order to make room for the number. This method would allow the contracts themselves to read the name.

For example, the sha3 of "hello" is `0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8`. This would be the key that is actually used at the contract level. If multiple "hello" keys were needed, the keys might look like `0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36dea00`, `0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36dea01`...

Anyone that would like to standardize a new data key should make a pull request to update the table below.

| Name | Description | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| owner | The owner of the identity | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| claims | The identity's claim holder contract (per [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735)) | 0x1744c2a923a4294f7e7e6fc2076e44b9126756e36bd413b902a2f66fb979b7ba |


## Rationale

The purpose of an identity proxy is to allow an entity to exist as a first-class citizen in Ethereum, with the ability to execute arbitrary contract calls, but with more complex management logic than what can be performed with a mere wallet. It also opens up the possibility of [meta transactions](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84), where a third party can trigger executions on behalf of an identity. Further, identity proxies can be the recipients of claims [via ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735), allowing claims to be held over a long period of time even if a user changes wallets.

This specification was chosen to allow the most flexibility and experimentation around identity. By having each identity in a separate contract it allows for cross identity compatibility, but at the same time extra and altered functionality for new use cases.

The rationale of this standard is to function as an open and very flexible container for identity.

interface ERC725 {
    event DataSet(bytes32 indexed key, bytes32 indexed value);

    function getData(bytes32 _key) external view returns (bytes32 _value);
    function setData(bytes32 _key, bytes32 _value) external;
    function execute(uint256 _operationType, address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) external;
