**This is the new 725 v2 standard, that is radically different from [ERC 725 v1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ede8c26a77eb1ac8fa2d01d8743a8cf259d8d45b/EIPS/eip-725.md). ERC 725 v1 is be moved to #734 as a new key manager standard.**
--------

## Simple Summary
A standard interface for a smart contract based account with attachable key value store.

## Abstract

The following describes standard functions for a unique smart contract based account that can be used by humans,
groups, organisations, objects and machines.

The standard is divided into two sub standards:

`ERC725X`:
Can execute arbitrary smart contracts using and deploy other smart contracts.

`ERC725Y`:
Can hold arbitrary data through a generic key/value store.

## Motivation

Standardizing a minimal interface for a smart contract based account allows any interface to operate through these account types.
Smart contact based accounts following this standard have the following advantages:

- can hold any asset (native token, e.g. ERC20 like tokens)
- can execute any smart contract and deploy smart contracts
- have upgradeable security (through owner change, e.g. to a gnosis safe)
- are basic enough to work for for a long time
- are extensible though additional standardisation of the key/value data.
- can function as an owner/controller or proxy of other smart contracts


## Specification

### ERC725X 

ERC165 identifier: `0x44c028fe`

#### execute

Executes a call on any other smart contracts, transfers the blockchains native token, or deploys a new smart contract.
MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

```js
function execute(uint256 operationType, address to, uint256 value, bytes data)
```

The `operationType` can execute the following operations:
- `0` for `call`
- `1` for `delegatecall`
- `2` for `create2`
- `3` for `create`

Others may be added in the future.

**Triggers Event:** [ContractCreated](#contractcreated) if a contract was created

### Events

#### ContractCreated

MUST be triggered when `execute` creates a new contract using the `_operationType` `1`.

```js
event ContractCreated(address indexed contractAddress)
```

### ERC725Y

ERC165 identifier: `0x2bd57b73`

#### getData

Returns the data at the specified key.

```js
function getData(bytes32 key) external view returns(bytes value)
```

#### setData

Sets the data at a specific key. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

**Triggers Event:** [DataChanged](#datachanged)

```js
function setData(bytes32 _key, bytes memory _value) external
```

### Events

#### DataChanged

MUST be triggered when `setData` was successfully called.

```js
event DataChanged(bytes32 indexed key, bytes value)
```


### Ownership

This contract is controlled by an owner. The owner can be a smart contract or an external account.
This standard requires [ERC173](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173) and should implement the functions:

`owner() view`, and `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` and the Event `event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)`

### Data keys

Data keys, should be the keccak256 hash of a type name.
e.g. `myNewKeyType` is `0xa94996022594f93c34a730df0ae89d1ecd69dff98c17d0387e69ce58346323a4`

#### Multiple keys of the same type

// TODO to be defined

Multiple keys for the same key type must add a `keyTypeName-1` at the end of the key type.

This would looks as follows for `myNewKeyType`:  
version 0 `myNewKeyType`: `0xa94996022594f93c34a730df0ae89d1ecd69dff98c17d0387e69ce58346323a4`   
version 1 `myNewKeyType-1`: `0xb6dace1ed14874742c4d1b8cd9b270305176f769e0ae22118a02c2db4e620f29`   
version 2 `myNewKeyType-2`: `0x6cc96a01de588f4550e8c3a821aed065ae7897f8dfb61836c78c0389e499d9ed`   
...

Anyone that would like to standardize a new data key should make a pull request to update the table below.

| Name | Description | Key | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 735 | The proxy accounts claim holder contract (per [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735)) | 0xb0f23aea7d77ce19f9393243a7b50a3bcaac893c7d68a5a309dea7cacf035fd0 | 20 bytes value `0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe` |
| 780 | The proxy accounts claim holder contract (per [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735)) | 0xdaf52dba5981246bcf8fd7c6b00dce587fdcf5e2a95b281eea95dcd1376afdcd | 20 bytes value `0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe` |


## Rationale

The purpose of an smart contract account is to allow an entity to exist as a first-class citizen with the ability to execute arbitrary contract calls.
