Projects, please list your use cases for ERC725 below! You can make a pull request to update the table. :smiley:

| Project | Use case description |
| --- | --- |
| [Origin](https://www.originprotocol.com/en) | Origin Protocol is using ERC725 as the foundation for users' identities on Origin. ERC725 was chosen to maximize interoperability with other projects and Dapps in the future. Origin users have public profiles with attestations for things like email, phone number, and social media accounts. |
| [Caelum Labs](https://caelumlabs.com/) | Caelum Labs plans to use ERC725 as a basic Local/National ID system for Ethereum based Blockchains. Our main goal is to use it to stablish trust between people, companies and public administration, so Smart Contracts can be used for any process between them |
| [Hydro](https://hydrogenplatform.com/hydro) | Hydro plans to provide a platform layer to facilitate and improve aspects of the dApp development process, including identity management. Accordingly, Hydro plans to offer developers a standard implementation of ERC725 in conjunction with other identity standards that can meet the specific needs of their applications. These identity standards are detailed in the [ERC 1484 reference repo](https://github.com/hydrogen-dev/ERC-1484). |
